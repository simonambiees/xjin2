# CTF Dev 2
This is my submission for CTF Problem Dev 2 assignment.
It is a forensics CTF called Trust My Files.
At its heart is a flag hidden inside an image file, with added elements of fun
in Trump theme.

## How to use
Copy the folder to cmgr/challenges.
Run cmgr update.
Then you can playtest it.
